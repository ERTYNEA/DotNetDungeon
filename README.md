# DotNetDungeon

## Requirements
- .NET SDK 9.0 or higher

## How to Run the Game

There are two ways to run the game:

### Method 1: From the game project folder
```bash
# Navigate to the game project folder
cd DotNetDungeon-Game

# Run the project
dotnet run
```

### Method 2: From the root folder
```bash
# Run the project specifying the path
dotnet run --project DotNetDungeon-Game/DotNetDungeon-Game.csproj
```

> **Note:** The second method works on any operating system, although on Windows you might need to use backslash (`\`) instead of forward slash (`/`) depending on the terminal you're using.
